# Testing Cup: Automated tests with Cypress #

Download or clone this repo.
Install dependencies by running the following command in terminal: 

* npm install (install dependencies)

* npx cypress run  (this command runs your first test)

* npm run test (this command runs the Mochawesome and creat the HTML report)


I used the Automated Software Testing Arena https://testingcup.pgs-soft.com/ for testing with cypress.
